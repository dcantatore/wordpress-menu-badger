This is a plugin to add a badge to a menu item. If you create a new page or feature on your website you can easily add a badge to highlight it.  

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin to add a badge to your menu. If you create a new page or feature on your website you can easily add a badge or button over top that says new, has a number like with apple notifications, or upload your own. 

If you have any features you would like added to the next version or encounter any bugs please <a href="mailto:squidstack@gmail.com?Subject=Support" target="_top">contact me</a>.


== Installation ==


1. Upload the plugin directory ‘menu-badge’ to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the side bar item called Menu Badge to configure the plugin.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use my own image? =
Yes you can, there is a feature to upload your own image.

= What type of image does it need to be, are they any specifications? =
Use a png with a clear background so that it appears as a button and not a square box.
Also you will want to keep the file size to 500-150px to save on load time. 

= Can you make this work with my theme? =
In some instances people write code for their theme in a non standard way that causes the badges to appear wrong or not at all. If this is the case please email me and I will look at your site and patch the plugin to work. It currently works on 90%+ of sites tested. 


== Screenshots ==

1. This is the configuration screen for the plugin. With these options selected your plugin will appear as the second screen shot does. You can adjust any of these or upload your own image.
2. This shows that you selected the iOS style badge 1 for your sample page and have chosen to display it small. The adjust badge location numbers have aligned it properly. You will need to adjust your badges based on your theme and visual preferences.
